		},
		{
			"name": "Iwan",
			"text": "They stopped caring quite some time ago. If we survive a few years here I guess the scene will become finally free of actors. Also we're on mission."

			"text": "Aha, so you still believe that madman, do you?"
		},
		{
			"name": "Iwan",
			"text": "Out of all people. we don't have many to believe and none to trust. He sent his son with us, so he believes in mission. That is enough for me."

			"name": "Iwan",
			"text": "Open your eyes, you're not an actor Jakob. We just found our good places to look at final scene of the play and do something real for a change."

		{
			"name": "Jakob",
			"text": "You sound exactly like him, I guess that can't be avoided. If I were not ready I would not be here now. But what about the place?"
		},
		{
			"name": "Iwan",
			"text": "It is sacred place. Not in religious way. A piece of history which survived all the history rewriting, politicans of old and now."
		},
		{
			"name": "Iwan",
			"text": "In old times it was sacred grounds with many temples for ancient gods of ancient tribes. It was a monastery, madmen house, place to drop people and throw away the key."

			"text": "Well, I can't say they would thank anyone for spending whole time in jail doing honest work just because their parents did something they even don't know."
		},
		{
			"name": "Jakob",
			"text": "Well, they had to burn their parents otherwise the regime could collapse as it requires full loyality from citizens."

			"text": "That slave needs to want freedom first and know what to do with it. You can manipulate him into believing that he wants freedom and knows what to do, but as illusion falls, you end up failed."
